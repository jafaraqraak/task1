            <p>Shakshouka is a delicious combination of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce. Although it has an unusual
                name,
                the dish is straightforward and easy to make. It is usually made in a skillet in which onions, tomatoes,
                and
                spices are cooked until they form a delicious tomato sauce.

            <p>Maqluba is the national dish of Palestine, but it can also be found in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan. This layered one-pot dish has many versions, but the basic principle is to turn it upside down before serving, which is what the word maqluba means.
